**Description**

Connecting your Slack channel to be able to play your Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. 

**How it works**

Rock, Paper, Scissor's game was coded in python and uses [NodeJS/NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) and [Webapp2](https://webapp-improved.appspot.com/). When the script is run, it is the server that can receive POST request from [Slack](https://slack.com/).

**Description**

A Rock, Paper, Scissor game that you can connect to your [Slack](https://slack.com/) Channel. 


**How it works**

Rock, Paper, Scissor's game was coded in python and uses [NodeJS/NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) and [Webapp2](https://webapp-improved.appspot.com/). When the script is run, the server can receive POST request from [Slack](https://slack.com/).
